# Promises

Create and consume a promise.

## Hint:

1.  Create a function with only a return statement:

    return new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{
    //write code here
    //at some point make a decision to resolve or reject
    //return by calling resolve(result) or reject(error)
    //The parameter in resolve is passed to .then
    //Note: you don't have to pass anything back.
    //The parameter in reject is passed to .catch
    })

2.  Consume promise:

    function().then(result=>{}).catch(error=>{})
